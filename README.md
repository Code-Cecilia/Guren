A discord bot written by [YuiiiiPTChan](https://github.com/YuiiiPTChan) in python using the library discord.py [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)
Don't use my code without crediting. You are free to host it and fork it yourself but don't claim my code as yours.

This README.md file is outdated and it will shortly be updated to match the bot updates.

- Note: There's still some stuff that is not working, i just uploaded earlier so i can revert things if it breaks the bot completely.

- Note 2: Temporarily left this project due to private reasons. Do not use this bot as it is and if you want to update the code then pull request but please do not re-publish it.

- Note 3: Working on the project again, if you want a stable instance up and running of the bot use my own. [Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=669973381067571240&scope=bot&permissions=8)

- Note 4: This readme will be reworked tomorrow! :D
